    <abbr title="HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures content on the web, using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML uses tags, usually in pairs like `<p>` and `</p>`, to define elements. It forms the backbone of all websites, allowing text, images, and multimedia to be displayed in a browser. HTML works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create complete, functional web pages.">HTML</abbr>

    <!-- Semantic Meaning: The <cite> tag gives semantic meaning to the text, indicating that it refers to a title of a work. This can help with accessibility and search engines.

    Default Styling: Browsers usually display the content inside the <cite> tag in italics by default, though this can be customized with CSS.

    Proper Use: The <cite> tag should only be used for titles of works, not for referencing names of people, organizations, or other non-work-related entities. -->
