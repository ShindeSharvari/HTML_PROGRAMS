    <!-- Explanation of the <time> Tag and datetime Attribute
        <time> Tag:
        
        The <time> tag is used to wrap dates or times in your document. It makes the time-related content both human-readable and understandable to machines.
        datetime Attribute:
        
        The datetime attribute provides the date or time in a standardized format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD for dates). This format is essential for search engines, browsers, and other tools that need to process the time data programmatically.
        Example Usage:
        
        In the example, the date "September 15, 2024" is displayed to users, but the underlying datetime="2024-09-15" attribute provides a precise, machine-readable format.
        Similarly, the articleâ€™s publication date "August 12, 2024" is marked up with <time datetime="2024-08-12">, making it easy for search engines to understand and index the publication date.
        Usefulness of the <time> Tag
        SEO and Accessibility: The <time> tag with the datetime attribute improves SEO by making dates and times machine-readable, helping search engines index the content more effectively.
        Event Handling: For events or articles, marking up dates and times ensures that software like calendars, reminders, or aggregators can extract and use the date information correctly.
        Consistency: It ensures that the date or time is consistently presented across different platforms and devices, which is particularly useful for international audiences.
        Summary
        The <time> tag with the datetime attribute is an important tool in HTML for marking up dates and times in a way that is both user-friendly and machine-readable. It is particularly useful for events, articles, and any other content where accurate date and time representation is crucial. -->
