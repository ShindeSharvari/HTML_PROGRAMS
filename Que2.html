    <h1>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</h1>

    <h2>width=device-width: </h2>
    <p>This setting makes the width of the viewport (the visible area of a web page) equal to the width of the deviceâ€™s screen. Whether the user is on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop, the content will scale to fit the screen.</p>

    
    <h2>initial-scale=1.0:</h2>
    <p>This sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. A value of 1.0 means the page will appear at the default scale (no zoom).</p>
